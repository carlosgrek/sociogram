I experimented with D3.js to create interactive sociograms that visualize relationships in both family and friend networks. The graphs are force-directed, meaning the layout adjusts dynamically as nodes (people) and links (relationships) interact, and they can be dragged around to explore the network. This was a fun way to play with D3 inside React and see how relationship data can be brought to life visually.
